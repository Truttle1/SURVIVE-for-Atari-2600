Game written by Truttle1 in 6502 assembly for Atari 2600. I actually made this game for TI-84 back during my freshman year Geometry class, and I figured it would be easy enough to port to the Atari. The 2600 is honestly a very difficult system to develop for, so I guess that's the reason why its library got polluted with shovelware, which would probably include this game if it existed back during the Atari's lifetime.
